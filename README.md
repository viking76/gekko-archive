# Install with docker

## Environnement variable

HOST 192.168.x.x

PORT 3000

MEMORYNODE 2048

USE_SSL 0

Prefer to use the real ip of the machine to test.
Ajust MEMORYNODE for max memory size under the limit of memory of container -10% was good
 



#### Before start container set the correct IP adress and local Port.
If you change Ip: localhost to another and start container and it be wrong IP. change manualy IP on
nano /usr/src/app/web/vue/dist/UIconfig.js or delete container and rebuild
